subtitle: Why was ObservedEarth created

The have been a number of developments over the last few years that make ObservedEarth possible:

- Open data initiatives are making available large amounts of information available. ObservedEarth really only scrapes the surface of what is currently available.
- Compute capability of mobile devices is nearing that of desktop-class performance. This is especially true when leveraging GPU compute capability<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>.
- Data download speeds. Downloading several hundred megabytes of Landsat data is now trivial compared to that of a weekend Netflix binge<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>.

ObservedEarth is hoping to fill the gap between published open data and 'non-technical' users. Whether or not earth observation data is of interest to these users is something to be understood.
