ObservedEarth is an app that simplifies the process of obtaining, processing, and visualising multispectral earth observation data. *It allows you to see Earth from above*.

A range of mobile and web based applications exist that provide access to satellite imagery.

Watch rivers change their path over time, destruction caused by bushfires and the following regrowth, expansion of urban developments, snowfalls,
the list of potential uses is significant.

The richness of the multispectral data is exposed through a series of present band combinations to highlight specific features. By mapping three of the
