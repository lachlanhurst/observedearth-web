### Landsat scenes
The Landsat 8 satellite orbits Earth approximately once every 100 minutes, with each orbit traveling a different path. There are a finite number of paths, and Landsat 8 will repeat the same path once every 16 days. Each path is broken down into a number of rows, Landsat scanline data is grouped into rows. The combination of a unique path and row identifies a Landsat scene, in its raw form Landsat data is made available on a scene-by-scene basis. Scenes for all land areas are shown below (red boxes).

These same scenes are displayed within ObservedEarth, although the number of scenes displayed at any one time is limited to reduce visual clutter. Note the path and row of the centremost scene are displayed in the lower left of the earth view.
