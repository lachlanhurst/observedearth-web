ObservedEarth supports exporting of single images, animated GIFs, and videos. This capability is accessed through the share button shown below, when pressed the share sheet is displayed allowing the content to be posted to a number of sources directly.

The content generated by ObservedEarth is dependent on the current view mode:
: ^
* In stack mode; where scenes are shown stacked on top of each other.
    * Selecting a single scene and pressing share will generate a single png image of the selected scene.
        * To select a scene simply tap it, selected scenes are surrounded by a red border.
    * Selecting multiple scenes will generate an animated GIF.
* In zoom mode; activated by pinching out to zoom in on a specific scene.
    * A single png image will be generated of the selected scene.
* In play mode; activated by pressing the play button.
    * A movie is generated of all scenes present in the stack.

There are several [settings](../settings) that affect the output from ObservedEarth, this includes being able to modify the resolution of exported images/videos and what details are overlaid (eg; timestamp, path and row).

### Tips
ObservedEarth attempts to keep the size of animated GIFs under 5MB, therefore the more scenes selected for export, the lower the resolution of the export. Exporting a video from play mode would be the preferred option, this typically produces smaller file sizes and better quality.

Sharing an animated GIF directly to Twitter reduces it to a single image. This has been a longstanding issue within iOS and is not specific to ObservedEarth. To workaround this save the animated GIF to your photos, then attach the GIF to your tweet in the native Twitter client.
